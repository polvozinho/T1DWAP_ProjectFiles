This is a repository for the completed project files for my cataloging and mapping of Delaware's Insect Species of Greatest Conservation Need and their non-tidal wetland associations.
It will be updated periodically as files are completed.
Current priority is completing mapping of non-tidal wetland habitats in GIS, then associated T2 insects, then T3, and finally the unplaced tier due to limited data.
Depending on the 2025 DWAP this might drastically
